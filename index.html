      <h2>“Middle Eastern”</h2>

      <p>I like chai with my conversations,<br>
      not chai tea, only chai;<br>
      its strong and intoxicating fumes,<br>
      the lapping waves of...<br>
      <em>home</em>—<br>
      and there you are again: nostalgia</p>

      <p>My mother would take a sip of chai,<br>
      and follow with it, that familiar groan,<br>
      never perfect—Dee's chai—yet my favorite,<br>
      and then we would sit on that impossibly small balcony,<br>
      ponder, sonder, and weave ebullient conversation</p>

      <p>Mum would curse the crows that crowded the tamarind trees,<br>
      the trees we'd hurl stones at after school for a snack,<br>
      and as time went on, they'd hang up more targets for us,<br>
      their precious veiny hands and the shadows they'd cast upon us,<br>
      yes, the trees were also an adult to my childlike eyes</p>

      <p>My people, from the East to the West and farther,<br>
      people of Deodars, Dates, Sycamores, Argans and Olives,<br>
      were born in the sap, to seep through the bark,<br>
      the mystery of exploitation and generous, generous land,<br>
      I call my home only where free, my people may stand,</p>

      <p><em>so...</em><br>
              I don't mind your questions—no, they aren't ridiculous,<br>
      To grow is to learn—from people within and beside you,<br>
      And yes for the hundredth time today,<br>
      I say I'm not Middle Eastern—but we're as one every other way,<br>
      because my people are your people and your people are mine too</p>

      <p>The silence of a<br>
                                   tip <br>
                                        tip <br>
                                             tip<br>
      and then falls a drop on my cheek,<br>
      I'm back home with chai under a dry tamarind tree,<br>
      and then I ask my sister how long I've been here,<br>
      "I don't recall you leaving," she sets down a pack of cookies,<br>
      and when I dunk one in my chai,<br>
      it breaks off and so—I groan again :)</p>
